# Simple-RPG
This is a 'simple' text based RPG that is being made by youtuber [Michael Burgess MikeBur](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCnfUlKuIKuN7mvr60cXm9zg?view_as=subscriber) Programmed in Kotlin.

## How to run this app.
Unfortunetely I have not done enough to the project to give myself a reason to package it as an .exe.
So Instead you will have to compile and run it through your IDE.
*Make sure it supports Kotlin

## Goals of this project.
To make a game that's easy to expand on by adding in weapons, maps, quests, etc.

## Why I started this.
I started this project back in late september to teach myself how to program in kotlin. I am now using these skills to work on an android app that you can hear about later on my youtube channel.

## Why am I releasing this?
I want people to be able to learn from it and/or help make a game that is honestly too big for it's style.
