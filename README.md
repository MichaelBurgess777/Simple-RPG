# Simple-RPG
This is a simple text based RPG that is being made by youtuber Michael Burgess(MikeBur) Programmed in Kotlin.

## How to run this app.
Unfortunetely I have not done enough to the project to give myself a reason to package it as an .exe.
So Instead you will have to compile and run it through your IDE.
*Make sure it supports Kotlin

## Goals of this project.
To make a game that's easy to expand on by adding in weapons, maps, quests, etc.

## Why I started this.
I started this project back in late september to teach myself how to program in kotlin.

## Why am I releasing this?
I want people to be able to learn from it and/or help make a game that is honestly too big for it's style.
